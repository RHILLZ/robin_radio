# Task 9 Implementation Summary: Network Service

## Overview

Successfully implemented **Task 9: Create Network Service** for the Robin Radio Flutter app, creating a comprehensive network connectivity and quality management solution with real-time monitoring, retry mechanisms, and extensive testing.

## Implementation Details

#### Key Features:

- Generic connectivity monitoring with reactive streams
- Quality assessment with latency and bandwidth testing

- **NetworkRetryException**: Max attempts exceeded, retry timeouts, invalid config
- **NetworkMonitoringException**: Start failures, already active, platform not supported
- **NetworkReachabilityException**: Host unreachable, DNS failures, connection timeouts
- **NetworkServiceInitializationException**: Platform not supported, permissions denied
- **NetworkUsageException**: Tracking not available, insufficient permissions, data collection failures

### 3. Enhanced Network Service (`lib/data/services/network/enhanced_network_service.dart`)

- **Singleton pattern** implementation for application-wide network management

### 4. Mock Network Service (`lib/data/services/network/mock_network_service.dart`)

- **Complete mock implementation** for testing and development
- **Controllable network states** with simulated connectivity changes
- **Failure simulation** with configurable failure rates and scenarios
- **Mock usage tracking** with simulated bandwidth consumption
- **Testing utilities** for disconnection/reconnection scenarios
